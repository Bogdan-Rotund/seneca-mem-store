This module is a plugin for the Seneca framework. It provides an
in-memory storage engine that provides a set of data storage action
patterns. *Data does not persist betweens runs*.  This plugin is most
useful for early development and unit testing. It also provides an
example of a document-oriented storage plugin code-base.

The Seneca framework provides an [ActiveRecord-style data storage API][].
Each supported database has a plugin, such as this one, that provides
the underlying Seneca plugin actions required for data persistence.

This plugin is included with the main seneca module.

- __Version:__ 0.3.1
